        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Connor Carpenter, I am 19 years old and go to college at Penn State Behrend
            and I am a freshman in my second semester. I graduated from Iroquois Jr/Sr High School
            here in Erie PA, and I have lived here my whole life. I am going to Behrend for a DIGIT
            major, hoping to get a degree in Graphics Design or some other degree that allows me to
            express my creativity. I currently live on campus, and in my free time, I really enjoy
            working out at Erie Hall and playing basketball with my friends. I love music and always
            have it playing through my headphones throughout the day. I also play video games at
            night in my dorm with my friends. During the day after going to class, I spend a lot of
            time studying in the library, which I find to be pretty peaceful. </p>
