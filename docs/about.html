        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Connor Carpenter, I am 19 years old and go to college at Penn State Behrend
            and I am a freshman in my second semester. I graduated from Iroquois Jr/Sr High School
            here in Erie PA, and I have lived here my whole life. I am going to Behrend for a DIGIT
            major, hoping to get a degree in Graphics Design or some other degree that allows me to
            express my creativity. I currently live on campus, and in my free time, I really enjoy
            working out at Erie Hall and playing basketball with my friends. I love music and always
            have it playing through my headphones throughout the day. I also play video games at
            night in my dorm with my friends. During the day after going to class, I spend a lot of
            time studying in the library, which I find to be pretty peaceful. </p>

        <h4>Reflective Essay</h4>
        <p>What are the most significant challenges for a new learner? I think the most significant
            challenges for a new learner is first of all being able to memorize all the different
            types of code, there’s a lot of inputs whether it’s on Github or PSU Sites, and it can
            be easy to forget exactly what you need to input some times. On the other hand, once you
            have a website up and running, I think the other difficult thing is making sure
            everything is working and running properly. It only takes one misinput or piece of code
            to be typed wrong and everything will be off. It all has to be laid out well and it can
            be tough when you have a lot of code sitting in front of you. What advantages do you
            associate with one method over the other? For Github, there seems to be a lot more
            freedom with what you can do, since it’s basically just an empty shell for you to put
            whatever code in that you want. On PSU Sites, everything is nicely laid out for you and
            it’s easy to navigate to what you specifically want to add or edit, so it’s quite a bit
            easier for new developers. What challenges are there for modifying the layout and
            organization of each site? Once you open your Github shell, it basically gives you no
            help. Everything you do relies on you putting in your code and in order to do that, you
            need to have knowledge on what all the commands are and what they do, which can be
            challenging since there are so many. While PSU Sites provides more information and help,
            it seems to be a bit more limited with what you can do in comparison. What skills are
            necessary to learn and develop these sites in either format? There are plenty of skills
            necessary to effectively develop a website. Some include knowledge of HTML, JavaScript,
            and other programming languages and familiarity with Git, CMS platforms, and hosting
            services. Other skills such as communication, collaboration, problem solving, and time
            management are also important. What skills do you think you want to learn to improve on
            this website? I want to memorize all the commands so that I can code easily without
            forgetting what something does. Right now, I’m struggling a bit with knowing what
            command I need in order to add something I specifically want, so I have to look it up to
            remember. I want to be able to get to the point where I have all the commands memorized
            and have no issues coding. Include in this reflection page (on each site) a direct link
            to your alternate website. https://sites.psu.edu/digit10000/ </p>
