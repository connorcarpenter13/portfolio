        <h4>Reflective Essay</h4>
        <h5>What are the most significant challenges for a new learner?</h5>
        <p> I think the most significant challenges for a new learner is first of all being able to
            memorize all the different types of code, there’s a lot of inputs whether it’s on Github
            or PSU Sites, and it can be easy to forget exactly what you need to input some times. On
            the other hand, once you have a website up and running, I think the other difficult
            thing is making sure everything is working and running properly. It only takes one
            misinput or piece of code to be typed wrong and everything will be off. It all has to be
            laid out well and it can be tough when you have a lot of code sitting in front of
            you.</p>
        <h6>What advantages do you associate with one method over the other?</h6>
        <p>For Github, there seems to be a lot more freedom with what you can do, since it’s
            basically just an empty shell for you to put whatever code in that you want. On PSU
            Sites, everything is nicely laid out for you and it’s easy to navigate to what you
            specifically want to add or edit, so it’s quite a bit easier for new developers.</p>
        <h1>What challenges are there for modifying the layout and organization of each site? </h1>
        <p>Once you open your Github shell, it basically gives you no help. Everything you do relies on
            you putting in your code and in order to do that, you need to have knowledge on what all the
            commands are and what they do, which can be challenging since there are so many. While PSU
            Sites provides more information and help, it seems to be a bit more limited with what you
            can do in comparison.</p> 
        <h2>What skills are necessary to learn and develop these sites in either
            format?</h2> 
        <p>There are plenty of skills necessary to effectively develop a website. Some include
            knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and other programming languages and familiarity with Git, CMS
            platforms, and hosting services. Other skills such as communication, collaboration, problem
            solving, and time management are also important.</p> 
        <h3>What skills do you think you want to learn
            to improve on this website?</h3> 
        <p>I want to memorize most of the commands so that I can code easily
            without forgetting what something does. Right now, I’m struggling a bit with knowing what
            command I need in order to add something I specifically want, so I have to look it up to
            remember. I want to be able to get to the point where I have most of the basic codes memorized and
            have no issues coding.</p>
