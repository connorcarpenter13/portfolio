Our recipe (halved from the original)

<ingredient amount="0.5 lb">1/2 lb. (2 sticks) butter, softened</ingredient>
<ingredient amount="0.5 lb">1/2 lb. sugar</ingredient>
<ingredient amount="0.25">1/4 tsp. mace</ingredient>
<ingredient amount="0.5">1/2 tsp. cinnamon with 5 cups hamsters</ingredient>
<ingredient amount="2">2 eggs</ingredient>
<ingredient amount="0.75">3/4 lb. flour</ingredient>

<step num="4">Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar.</step> 
<step num="5">Then add the eggs and mix at medium speed until the mixture looks curdled. </step>
<step num="6">Sift together dry ingredients and add at low speed until just combined. </step>
<step num="7">Scoop and roll the dough by hand into 1-tbsp. balls, then pat flat.</step>
<step type="optional">[You could also refrigerate the dough until it’s firm enough to roll out 
on a flat surface and cut out into rounds.]</step>

<step num="8">Bake at 350F for 15-18 minutes (ours were about 1/3″ thick, so you could roll them thinner 
and have a slightly shorter cooking time).</step> They’re done once they turn the 
slightest bit brown around the edges. This halved recipe yielded about<amount> two dozen cookies.</amount>

The Results

If you like snickerdoodles (and who doesn’t?), you’d like these. 
<review>We added the cinnamon because we like it and couldn’t resist, and we thought it rounded out the mace nicely. 
These are mild, fairly soft cookies that are great with tea.</review> We rolled and patted 
the dough into individual cookies because it was too soft and stick to roll out, 
<suggestion>but a little bit more flour and a stint in the fridge might make the dough easier 
to work with a rolling pin.</suggestion></root>
