    <rhymescheme type="ABCB">Booker T. Was a practical<rhyme sound="an">man</rhyme>. He said, Till
        the soil And learn from the <rhyme sound="an">land.</rhyme></rhymescheme>
    <rhymescheme type="ABCB">Let down your bucket Where you <rhyme sound="ar">are.</rhyme> Your fate

    <rhymescheme type="ABCB">To help yourself And your fellow <rhyme sound="an">man,</rhyme> Train
        your head, Your heart, and your<rhyme sound="an"> hand.</rhyme></rhymescheme>
    <rhymescheme type="ABCB">For smartness alone's Surely not<rhyme sound="eat"> meet—</rhyme> If
        you haven't at the same time Got something to <rhyme sound="eat">eat.</rhyme></rhymescheme>
    <rhymescheme type="ABCB">Thus at Tuskegee He built a <rhyme sound="ool">school</rhyme> With
        book-learning there And the workman's<rhyme sound="ool"> tool.</rhyme></rhymescheme>
    <rhymescheme type="ABCB">He started out In a simple <rhyme sound="ay">way—</rhyme> For yesterday
        Was not <rhyme sound="ay">today</rhyme>.</rhymescheme>
    <rhymescheme type="ABCB">Sometimes he had Compromise in his <rhyme sound="alk">talk—</rhyme> For
        a man must crawl Before he can <rhyme sound="alk">walk—</rhyme></rhymescheme> And in Alabama
    in '85 A joker was lucky To be alive. <rhymescheme type="ABCB">But Booker T. Was nobody's <rhyme

    <rhymescheme type="ABCB">The tallest tower Can tumble <rhyme sound="oun">down</rhyme> If it be
        not rooted In solid <rhyme sound="oun">ground.</rhyme></rhymescheme>
    <rhymescheme type="ABCB">So, being a far-seeing Practical<rhyme sound="an">man,</rhyme> He said,
        Train your head, Your heart, and your <rhyme sound="an">hand.</rhyme></rhymescheme>
    <rhymescheme type="ABCB">Your fate is here And not <rhyme sound="ar">afar,</rhyme> So let down
        your bucket Where you <rhyme sound="ar">are.</rhyme></rhymescheme>
